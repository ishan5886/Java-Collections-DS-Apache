STREAMS:-

Process objects/elements from Collections

Streams provide two different mechanisms to process objects/elements from Collections - Filter, Map

Filter -> Used to filter values from a collection to use for other operations or use filtered values in other collections

Map -> Apply certain operations on every element and then use the resulting values in another collection or for some other operations

Add objects/elements from the Collection into a Stream, perform Filter/Map on stream and then store it in another collection.

Terminal Operation Methods available in Streams:-

	> Collect()- Collect data from Stream and use in another Collection
	> Sorted() - After data from Stream stored in another collection, used to sort the values
	> Count() - Count number of elements in Collection from Stream 
	> Distinct() - to find out unique values - Non Terminal Method
	> forEach() - Read each and every value from Stream
	> min()
	> max()
	>toArray
	
	
FLAT MAP -> For Complex Collections
Map returns single object after an operation, FlatMap returns a stream of objects
